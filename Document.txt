In fruit industries or farms, fruits are currently packed according to its categories such as ripe, un-ripe, over-ripe and so on by human experts. This subjective process is error-prone and time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a robot which can pack fruits automatically according to their categories. This robot will take the photo of the fruit and use digital image processing techniques to categorize the fruits.

1. Cost reduction.
2. Time minimization.
3. Less human intervention.
4. Product waste decrement.
5. Less error-prone.
